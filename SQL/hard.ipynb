One way to remove the repeating code segment would be to use Common Table Expression (however, I do not think this can be done in leetcode). Another way might be to use variables. However, we can also leverage a trick based on how MySQL handles aggregates when sql_mode=only_full_group_by is disabled (which is the case in leetcode). MySQL simple picks the first item in a row when a column is in the SELECT clause but not the GROUP BY clause. Other databases would throw an error. Therefore we can simply get the players' scores (ps) like we did in Solution 1 along with the group_id of each player by joining the subquery with the Players table.
